# SpringBootCRUDOPERATIONCode
It is a  CRUD operations in a runtime environment without using a database. The data is stored only on the server side during runtime. I have implemented the backend to handle data using the POST method with a JSON file, where we take input for student details, including student ID, name, and section.
